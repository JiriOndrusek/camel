/**
 * The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays.
 * This object is a superset of the JSON Schema Specification Draft 07.
 *
 * Further information about the properties can be found in JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation. Unless stated otherwise,
 * the property definitions follow the JSON Schema specification as referenced here.
 *
 * Properties
 * The AsyncAPI Schema Object is a JSON Schema vocabulary which extends JSON Schema Core and Validation vocabularies. As such,
 * any keyword available for those vocabularies is by definition available in AsyncAPI, and will work the exact same way, including but not limited to:
 *
 * title
 * type
 * required
 * multipleOf
 * maximum
 * exclusiveMaximum
 * minimum
 * exclusiveMinimum
 * maxLength
 * minLength
 * pattern (This string SHOULD be a valid regular expression, according to the ECMA 262 regular expression dialect)
 * maxItems
 * minItems
 * uniqueItems
 * maxProperties
 * minProperties
 * enum
 * const
 * examples
 * if / then / else
 * readOnly
 * writeOnly
 * properties
 * patternProperties
 * additionalProperties
 * additionalItems
 * items
 * propertyNames
 * contains
 * allOf
 * oneOf
 * anyOf
 * not
 * The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema definition but their definitions were adjusted to the AsyncAPI Specification.
 *
 * description - CommonMark syntax can be used for rich text representation.
 * format - See Data Type Formats for further details. While relying on JSON Schemaâ€™s defined formats, the AsyncAPI Specification offers a few additional predefined formats.
 * default - The default value represents what would be assumed by the consumer of the input as the value of the schema if one is not provided. Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined type for the Schema Object defined at the same level. For example, of type is string, then default can be "foo" but cannot be 1.
 * Alternatively, any time a Schema Object can be used, a Reference Object can be used in its place. This allows referencing definitions in place of defining them inline.
 *
 * In addition to the JSON Schema fields, the following AsyncAPI vocabulary fields MAY be used for further schema documentation:
 *
 * Fixed Fields
 *
 * todo This object can be extended with Specification Extensions.
