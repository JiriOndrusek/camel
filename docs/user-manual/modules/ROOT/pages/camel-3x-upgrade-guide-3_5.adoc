= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

Load-balancing policy has changed. There are no existing load balancing policies (see https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.3/upgrade_guide/#load-balancing-policy[upgrade_guide]).

To customize load balancing policy, please use the parameter `loadBalancingPolicyClass` and provide own implementation
of load balancing policy.
